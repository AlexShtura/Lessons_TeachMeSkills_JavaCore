Expo 2020 Dubai is finally open. Called the world's greatest show, the city will host an estimated 25 million visitors from around the world for 182 days. Eight months after originally planned, Expo 2020, Dubai has opened to the world under its theme of 'Connecting Minds, Creating the Future'. It marks the biggest global event on this scale to be held since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A showcase of contemporary solutions
Expo 2020 Dubai is the 35th world fair over the past 170 years. They're designed to showcase ideas, inventions, and innovations that tackle the world's problems. The opening ceremony featured the world-famous tenor Andrea Bocelli, singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and Grammy Award winner Angelique Kidjo amongst many others.

192 countries are taking part in the event which will continue for the next six months. The three sub-themes are sustainability, mobility, and opportunity. Many events will be streamed live online, but Expo 2020 still officially expects to attract more visitors than previous host Milan as the travel restrictions ease globally.

The deputy general commissioner of the Spain Pavilion, Carmen Bueno, said the event was important as it is the first real gathering of its kind since the global pandemic hit. “It's going to be a physical gathering of people from many diverse parts. We are ready to visit and we are ready to experience and to share experiences with others.”
